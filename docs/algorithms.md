# Commonly Used Algorithms

| algorithm | Discription | problems |
|---|---|---|
| Two Pointers | Useful for problems involving arrays or linked lists where you need to find pairs or subarrays |
| Sliding Window | Helps in problems where you need to find a subarray that meets certain criteria |
| Binary Search | Efficient for sorted arrays to find an element or its position |
| Dynamic Programming | Breaks down problems into simpler subproblems and stores the results to avoid redundant calculations | 
| Depth-First Search (DFS) | Useful for exploring all possible paths in a graph or tree |
|Breadth-First Search (BFS)| Good for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph | 
| Backtracking | Helps in problems where you need to explore all possible configurations, like puzzles or combination |
| Greedy Algorithms | Optimal for problems where making the locally optimal choice leads to a global optimum |
| Divide and Conquer | Breaks the problem into smaller parts, solves them independently, and combines the results |
| Heap/Priority Queue | Useful for problems involving finding the largest or smallest elements, like Kth largest element |
